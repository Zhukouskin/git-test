What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees

Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
